Although the abstract theory of model categories gives us tools to construct a homotopy relation (\DefinitionRef{homotopy}), it is useful to have a concrete notion of homotopic maps.

Consider the free cdga on one generator $\Lambda(t, dt)$, where $\deg{t} = 0$, this can be thought of as the (dual) unit interval with endpoints $1$ and $t$. We define two \emph{endpoint maps} as follows:
$$ d_0, d_1 : \Lambda(t, dt) \to \k $$
$$ d_0(t) = 1, \qquad d_1(t) = 0, $$
this extends linearly and multiplicatively. Note that it follows that we have $d_0(1-t) = 0$ and $d_1(1-t) = 1$. These two functions extend to tensor products as $d_0, d_1: \Lambda(t, dt) \tensor X \to \k \tensor X \tot{\iso} X$.

\Definition{cdga_homotopy}{
	We call $f, g: A \to X$ homotopic ($f \simeq g$) if there is a map
	$$ h: A \to \Lambda(t, dt) \tensor X, $$
	such that $d_0 h = g$ and $d_1 h = f$.
}

In terms of model categories, such a homotopy is a right homotopy and the object $\Lambda(t, dt) \tensor X$ is a path object for $X$. We can easily see that it is a very good path object. First note that $\Lambda(t, dt) \tensor X \tot{(d_0, d_1)} X \oplus X$ is surjective (for $(x, y) \in X \oplus X$ take $t \tensor x + (1-t) \tensor y$). Secondly we note that $\Lambda(t, dt) = \Lambda(D(0))$ and hence $\k \to \Lambda(t, dt)$ is a cofibration, by \LemmaRef{model-cats-coproducts} we have that $X \to \Lambda(t, dt) \tensor X$ is a cofibration.

Clearly we have that $f \simeq g$ implies $f \simeq^r g$ (see \DefinitionRef{right_homotopy}), however the converse need not be true.

\Lemma{cdga_homotopy}{
	If $A$ is a cofibrant cdga and $f \simeq^r g: A \to X$, then $f \simeq g$ in the above sense.
}
\Proof{
	Because $A$ is cofibrant, there is a very good homotopy $H$. Consider a lifting problem to construct a map $Path_X \to \Lambda(t, dt) \tensor X$.
}

\Corollary{cdga_homotopy_eqrel}{
	For cofibrant $A$, $\simeq$ defines a equivalence relation.
}
\Definition{cdga_homotopy_classes}{
	For cofibrant $A$ define the set of equivalence classes as:
	$$ [A, X] = \Hom_{\CDGA_\k}(A, X) / \simeq. $$
}

The results from model categories immediately imply the following results. \todo{Refereer expliciet}
\Corollary{cdga_homotopy_properties}{
	Let $A$ be cofibrant.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let $i: A \to B$ be a trivial cofibration, then the induced map $i^\ast: [B, X] \to [A, X]$ is a bijection.
		\item Let $p: X \to Y$ be a trivial fibration, then the induced map $p_\ast: [A, X] \to [A, Y]$ is a bijection.
		\item Let $A$ and $X$ both be cofibrant, then $f: A \we X$ is a weak equivalence if and only if $f$ is a strong homotopy equivalence. Moreover, the two induced maps are bijections:
		$$ f_\ast: [Z, A] \tot{\iso} [Z, X], $$
		$$ f^\ast: [X, Z] \tot{\iso} [A, X]. $$
	\end{itemize}
}

\Lemma{cdga_homotopy_homology}{
	Let $f, g: A \to X$ be two homotopic maps, then $H(f) = H(g): HA \to HX$.
}
\Proof{
	We only need to consider $H(d_0)$ and $H(d_1)$. \todo{Bewijs afmaken}
